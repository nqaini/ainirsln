			<p>My experience is relatively moderate considering that I am still pursuing higher education,
			however the 2-months internship that I had during the previous 
			semester break has taught me a lot, as well learning to 
			improvise and utilize my knowledge that has been engraved 
			to me during my study and time as I attend university. That
			being said, I also have a few experience regarding on how to stock-taking books, 
			cataloging, shelving as well circulation, all of which are essential to the library industry, which I have gained in my experience.</p></td>

			one of my strongest passion and talent. I also enjoy listening to songs and
				play games during my free time.</p></td>
